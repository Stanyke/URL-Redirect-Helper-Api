# Redirect-Helper-Api
This node app's API helps you in decoding URLs, especially URLs that redirect to other URLs, to get the final URL

The /api/v1/final-url route does the main thing in handling the redirect URL final result.

The server is served on port 5000.
To start up the app, simply do the following:

    1. Run the npm install command to install allÂ dependencies.

    2. Then start the server with the `npm start` command.

Here you are, you're good to go now.

## Thank you
